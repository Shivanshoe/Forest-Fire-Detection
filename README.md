# Forest-Fire-Detection

The project aims to develop a deep learning-based fire detection model capable of distinguishing between fire and non-fire images using advanced image classification techniques. Leveraging transfer learning, the model is designed to analyze imagery from remote sensing, contributing to efficient, automated fire monitoring in smart city applications.

# Run Code:

1. To run the code download the main jupyter notebook.
2. Download the dataset from the link and extract its contents where main.ipynb is located.
3. (Additionally) take the images from the random test images folder and store where main.ipynb is located.
